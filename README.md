# sbcctracker

this is a website I have been working on, coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
intended use is to track when classes in the sbcc class search system change from "closed" to "open."
notifies users when a class opens, through text or through email.
users have the ability to add or remove classes they want to track.
